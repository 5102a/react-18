# React 18 Working Group

This is the working group for React 18 release. It was formed to provide support to the community through the release. The working group is focused around online conversations which you can access by going to the [GitHub Discussions tab](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions).

Working group participants come from a representative set of the React community including educators, developers, and library authors. Participants can start GitHub discussions to ask questions and provide feedback on React 18. They can also comment on existing discussion threads.

The working group is currently structured to help manage discussions yet make the information available to everyone. The public can follow along by going to [the discussions tab](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions).

If you're looking for the first discussion to read, **[Introducing React 18](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4)** is a good starting point.
